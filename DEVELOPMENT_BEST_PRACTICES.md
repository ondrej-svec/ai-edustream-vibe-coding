## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites: Setting Up Your Development Environment

**Before you start the Quick Start, ensure you have these tools installed and configured.**

### Required Tools

#### 1. Node.js & npm (5 minutes)
```bash
# Check if you have Node.js installed
node --version
npm --version

# If not installed, download from https://nodejs.org/
# We recommend Node.js 18 or higher
```

#### 2. Git (2 minutes)
```bash
# Check if Git is installed
git --version

# If not installed, download from https://git-scm.com/
# Configure your Git identity
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

#### 3. VS Code with Cursor (10 minutes)
- **Download Cursor:** Go to [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh) and install
- **Why Cursor:** Built-in AI integration with TaskMaster MCP support

#### 4. TaskMaster Installation (3 minutes)

**Reference:** [TaskMaster Documentation](https://www.task-master.dev/)

```bash
# Install TaskMaster globally
npm install -g task-master-ai

# Verify installation
task-master --version

# You should see version 1.0.0 or higher
```

### TaskMaster Project Setup (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Initialize TaskMaster in Your Project
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory (or create a new one)
mkdir my-app && cd my-app

# Initialize TaskMaster - this creates .cursor/mcp.json and project structure
task-master init

# Models
# Use Claude 4 Sonnet for everything and sonar-pro for the research.
# main claude-sonnet-4-20250514
# research sonar-pro
# fallback claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

**üí° Pro Tip:** Use the same powerful model for all roles. Consistency beats complexity.

---

```

#### Step 2: Get API Keys
**Claude 4 Sonnet (Required):**
1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Create account and add billing
3. Generate API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

**Perplexity AI (Optional for research):**
1. Go to [perplexity.ai](https://perplexity.ai)
2. Get API access
3. Copy the API key

#### Step 3: Add API Keys to MCP Configuration
Edit the `.cursor/mcp.json` file that was created by `task-master init`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "task-master-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["task-master-ai", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-your-actual-api-key-here",
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-perplexity-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace the placeholder values with your actual API keys.**

#### Step 4: Test MCP Integration
1. Restart Cursor
2. Open any project folder
3. Start a new chat and ask: "Can you check if TaskMaster MCP is working?"
4. AI should respond confirming MCP access

### Environment Setup Verification (2 minutes)

Run this quick verification:
```bash
# Check all prerequisites
node --version    # Should show v18+ 
npm --version     # Should show 8+
git --version     # Should show 2.0+
task-master --version  # Should show 1.0+

# Test TaskMaster
task-master --help
```

**If everything shows versions, you're ready!**

### Troubleshooting Setup Issues

#### Problem: TaskMaster not found
```bash
# Solution: Install globally with npm
npm install -g task-master-ai

# If still not working, try:
npx task-master-ai --version
```

#### Problem: MCP not connecting in Cursor
- **Check:** API keys are valid in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Check:** JSON syntax is correct (no trailing commas)
- **Try:** Restart Cursor completely
- **Verify:** Ask AI "Can you access TaskMaster tools?"

#### Problem: API key errors
- **Claude:** Ensure you have billing set up at console.anthropic.com
- **Perplexity:** Verify your subscription includes API access
- **Format:** Keys should be strings without quotes in environment

### üéØ Quick Setup Test

Once everything is installed, test your setup:

```
You: "Can you help me test TaskMaster integration?"
AI: "I can access TaskMaster MCP tools. Let me verify by checking available commands..."
AI: [Should list TaskMaster capabilities]
```

**‚úÖ If AI can access TaskMaster tools, you're ready for the Quick Start!**

## üéØ The Core Insight: Why This Works

### The Problem with Traditional AI Development

Most developers treat AI like a fancy search engine:
- ‚ùå Ask random questions without context
- ‚ùå Get solutions that don't fit together  
- ‚ùå Lose progress between sessions
- ‚ùå No clear path from idea to finished product

### Our Solution: The Three Pillars

**üèóÔ∏è Pillar 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
Your single source of truth that keeps AI aligned with your vision.

**üìã Pillar 2: TaskMaster Integration**  
Structured project management that AI can read and update automatically.

**üìö Pillar 3: Documentation-as-You-Go**
AI documents every decision and action, creating a development log.

### The Magic Formula

```
Clear PRD + Structured Tasks + AI Documentation = Predictable Success
```

**Real Example:** Our coffee app PRD defined "5-step taste quiz with budget filtering." AI knew exactly what to build. No confusion, no re-work.

---

## üìã The Foundation: Setting Up for Success

### üéØ Creating Your PRD (The Right Way)

**Your PRD is your AI's compass.** Without it, AI makes assumptions that waste time.

#### The 7-Section PRD Template
```markdown
# [Project Name] - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Vision (You Define This)
One clear sentence about what you're building and why.

## 2. Target Users (Collaborate with AI)
Who will use this? What are their specific needs?

## 3. Core Features (AI Expands Your Ideas)
Break down functionality into specific, testable features.

## 4. Technical Requirements (Collaborate)
- Framework choices
- Key libraries  
- Performance requirements
- Device compatibility

## 5. Success Metrics (You Define This)
How will you know it works? Specific, measurable criteria.

## 6. Implementation Phases (AI Suggests)
What gets built first, second, third?

## 7. Development Log (AI Maintains)
Living record of decisions and progress.
```

#### ‚úÖ PRD Success Patterns

**Be Specific, Not Generic**
- ‚ùå "Build a recommendation system"
- ‚úÖ "Build a 5-step taste quiz that maps preferences to coffee characteristics with 80% accuracy"

**Include Technical Constraints**  
- ‚ùå "Make it look good"
- ‚úÖ "Use shadcn/ui components with warm colors, mobile-first responsive design"

**Define Measurable Success**
- ‚ùå "Users should like it"  
- ‚úÖ "80% quiz completion rate, <2s load time, works on mobile Safari"

### üõ†Ô∏è TaskMaster Setup

**TaskMaster turns your PRD into actionable tasks** that AI can understand and update.

#### Initial Setup
```
You: "I have my PRD ready. Can you help me set up TaskMaster?"
AI: "I'll initialize TaskMaster and convert your PRD into tasks..."
    [AI sets up project structure and creates initial tasks]
```

## üîÑ The Workflow: Your Daily Development Process

### üåÖ Session Start Ritual (2 minutes)

**Every development session starts the same way:**

```
You: "Let's continue working on [project name]"
AI: "I can see we have 12 tasks total, 8 completed. Task 15.2 is ready for implementation. 
    It's about building the coffee matching algorithm. Should we start there?"
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
- AI checks current project status
- Reviews completed and pending tasks  
- Identifies the next logical step
- Provides context for seamless continuation

### üíª Development Loop (The Heart of the Process)

#### Pattern 1: Feature Implementation
```
You: "Let's implement the taste quiz component"
AI: "Based on task 8.1, I need to create a multi-step form with validation. 
    I'll use React Hook Form and Zod for validation..."
    [AI implements the feature]
AI: "Here's the implementation. Key decisions I made:
    - Used sessionStorage for step persistence
    - Implemented progress indicator
    - Added mobile-optimized touch targets"
```

#### Pattern 2: Problem Solving
```
You: "The form state isn't persisting between steps"
AI: "I see the issue. Let me implement sessionStorage persistence and update 
    the task with this solution..."
    [AI fixes the problem and documents the solution]
```

#### Pattern 3: Feature Enhancement
```
You: "Can we add a coffee brewing method to the quiz?"
AI: "Great idea! I'll update the PRD to include brewing methods and create 
    new tasks for implementation..."
    [AI updates both PRD and task structure]
```

### üåÖ Session End Ritual (3 minutes)

**Always end sessions with documentation:**

```
You: "Thanks for the help today! Can you summarize what we accomplished?"
AI: "Absolutely! Here's our session summary:

‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- Implemented taste quiz with 5 steps
- Added form validation and error handling
- Created responsive mobile design

üèóÔ∏è KEY DECISIONS:
- Used React Hook Form for better UX
- Added sessionStorage for step persistence  
- Implemented progress indicator

üìÅ FILES MODIFIED:
- src/components/TasteQuiz.tsx (new component)
- src/types/preferences.ts (updated interfaces)

üêõ SOLVED:
- Form state persistence issue with sessionStorage solution

‚û°Ô∏è NEXT SESSION:
- Connect quiz results to recommendation engine
- Add loading states and animations
- Test on mobile devices

I've documented all of this in TaskMaster for perfect continuation next time."
```

**üíé The Magic:** You can stop and start anytime. AI maintains perfect context.

#### Debugging Complex Issues
```
You: "The coffee matching algorithm isn't working correctly"
AI: [Thinking process shows step-by-step analysis]
AI: "I can see the issue in my thinking process. The scoring logic 
    weights flavor preferences too heavily compared to budget constraints..."
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Transparent problem-solving
- ‚úÖ Learn AI's reasoning process  
- ‚úÖ Better debugging and optimization
- ‚úÖ Higher quality solutions

### üìä Complex Project Management

#### Managing Large Feature Sets
```
You: "We have 25 tasks. How should we prioritize?"
AI: "Let me analyze the dependencies and complexity scores..."
    [AI provides strategic breakdown]
AI: "I recommend this sequence: Core features ‚Üí User experience ‚Üí Optimization"
```

#### Handling Scope Changes
```
You: "We need to add user accounts. How does this affect our timeline?"
AI: "I'll update the PRD and analyze the impact on existing tasks..."
    [AI updates PRD and creates new task dependencies]
```

### üîÑ Advanced Documentation Patterns

#### Living Architecture Documentation
```
AI: "I'm updating the architecture docs to reflect the new authentication flow..."
    [AI maintains technical documentation automatically]
```

## üö® Troubleshooting: When Things Go Wrong

### Common Problems & Solutions

#### Problem: AI Loses Context
**Symptoms:** AI suggests solutions that don't fit your project
**Solution:** 
```
You: "Please check our current project status and PRD before suggesting solutions"
AI: [Reviews TaskMaster and PRD] "Now I see the context. Based on your 
    coffee app requirements..."
```

#### Problem: Task Scope Creep  
**Symptoms:** Simple tasks become complex multi-day efforts
**Solution:**
```
You: "This task is getting too complex. Can we break it down?"
AI: "You're right. Let me split this into 3 smaller, focused tasks..."
```

#### Problem: Inconsistent Code Patterns
**Symptoms:** New code doesn't match existing style
**Solution:**
```
You: "Please review our existing code patterns before implementing new features"
AI: "I'll examine the current codebase structure and follow established patterns..."
```

### üî• Red Flags to Watch For

- ‚ùå AI suggesting major architecture changes without PRD updates
- ‚ùå Tasks taking much longer than estimated
- ‚ùå Code that doesn't follow project conventions
- ‚ùå Missing documentation for implementation decisions

### Recovery Strategies

#### When Projects Go Off Track
1. **Return to PRD:** Re-align AI with original vision
2. **Task Audit:** Review and reorganize task structure  
3. **Documentation Review:** Check what decisions led to problems
4. **Fresh Start:** Begin new session with clear context
