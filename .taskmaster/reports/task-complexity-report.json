      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the comprehensive codebase audit into specific scanning activities: create subtasks for identifying mock data locations, cataloging dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage, finding repeated UI patterns, locating magic numbers/constants, and documenting input validation gaps. Each subtask should focus on specific file types or code patterns.",
      "reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to systematic nature requiring thorough code analysis across entire codebase. Multiple distinct patterns to identify make it suitable for parallel subtask execution."
