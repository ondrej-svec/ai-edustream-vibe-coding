# Task: Extract Repeated UI Patterns into Reusable Components

## What Needs to Be Done
Identify and extract repeated UI patterns from `src/pages/BeansList.tsx` and `src/components/CoffeeCard.tsx` into reusable components.

## How to Do It
- Review BeansList and CoffeeCard for repeated JSX/UI blocks (e.g., cards, badges, info sections).
- Create new reusable components in `src/components/` or a suitable subdirectory.
- Replace repeated code with the new components.
- Ensure all props and styles are flexible and well-documented.
- Add tests for the new components.

## Definition of Done
- No significant repeated UI code remains in BeansList or CoffeeCard.
- All repeated patterns are encapsulated in reusable components.
- New components are tested and documented.
