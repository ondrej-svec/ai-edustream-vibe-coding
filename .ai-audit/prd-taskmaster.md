# Product Requirements Document (PRD): AI Codebase Refactor & Productionization

## Background
The current codebase was generated using AI tools and contains several areas that are not production-ready, including mock data, incomplete flows, lack of validation, and missing documentation. The goal is to refactor and improve the codebase to meet production standards, improve maintainability, and ensure security.

## Objectives
- Replace all mock and placeholder logic with real, production-ready implementations
- Unify and centralize data types and constants
- Add robust input validation and error handling
- Ensure all dynamic HTML injection is safe and sanitized
- Abstract data fetching and handle loading/error states in the UI
- Extract and reuse UI patterns to reduce duplication
- Add comprehensive tests for all major flows
- Document all public APIs and complex logic

## Requirements
1. **Replace Mock Data**: All hardcoded/mock coffee data must be replaced with real API integration.
2. **Unify Types**: Coffee interfaces/types must be extracted to a shared file and reused throughout the codebase.
3. **Input Validation**: All user input must be validated before processing or sending to the backend.
4. **Sanitize HTML Injection**: All uses of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` must be audited and sanitized.
5. **Data Service & Loading/Error States**: All data fetching must be abstracted into a service, and UI must handle loading and error states.
6. **Extract UI Patterns**: Repeated UI code must be refactored into reusable components.
7. **Move Constants**: Magic numbers and constants must be moved to a dedicated file.
8. **Loading/Error UI**: All data-driven components must show loading and error states.
9. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests must be written for all major flows.
10. **Documentation**: All public APIs and complex logic must be documented.

## Deliverables
- Refactored codebase meeting all requirements above
- Centralized types and constants
- Data service abstraction
- Reusable UI components
- Comprehensive test suite
- Up-to-date documentation

## Success Criteria
- No mock data or placeholder logic remains
- All user input is validated and sanitized
- All data is fetched via a service and UI handles loading/errors
- No repeated UI code
- All major flows are tested
- Documentation is clear and complete
