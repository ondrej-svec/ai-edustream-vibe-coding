# Task: Document All Public APIs and Complex Logic

## What Needs to Be Done
Add clear documentation and comments to all public APIs, exported functions, and any complex or non-obvious logic in the codebase.

## How to Do It
- Review all exported functions, classes, and components.
- Add JSDoc or TypeScript comments explaining the purpose, parameters, and return values.
- For complex logic, add comments explaining why it is implemented a certain way.
- Avoid redundant comments; focus on intent and rationale.
- Ensure documentation is up to date and accurate.

## Definition of Done
- All public APIs and complex logic are clearly documented.
- Comments explain intent and rationale, not just what the code does.
- Documentation is helpful for onboarding new developers.
