# 🔍 AI Code Audit & Refactor Plan

You are a senior software architect reviewing a codebase generated using AI tools like v0, Lovable, or GPT-based prototyping.

This is a **first-pass production audit** focused on identifying code that is not production-ready — and creating a concrete plan to improve it inside Cursor.

## 🚨 Objectives

- Flag any code that’s risky, hard to maintain, or insecure
- Identify where mocked data, placeholder logic, or incomplete flows exist
- Highlight structural issues (bad naming, bloated files, poor separation of concerns)
- Generate **clear, refactorable TODOs** to address each issue
- Prioritize the top 5 refactors that would make the code significantly more robust

## 🧠 Deliverable Format

Please structure your output like this:

---

## 🔥 Major Issues

List the 3–5 **most critical production issues** found in the current codebase.  
For each, include:
- 🔹 File & line(s)
- 🧨 What's wrong
- 🛠 Recommended fix
- 🏷 Suggested TODO task (one-liner)

---

## 🛠️ Suggested Refactors (Ranked by Impact)

List 5–10 suggested improvements that would increase code quality, maintainability, or security.

For each:
- 🔸 Description
- 📁 Affected file(s)
- 💬 What the change will improve
- ✅ If safe to auto-refactor now, or needs review

---

## 🚨 Security & Data Risks

Flag anything related to:
- XSS, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, or raw HTML injection
- Missing input validation or user input sanitization
- ENV usage issues
- API keys exposed or misused

---

## 🧩 Mocked or Incomplete Areas

List:
- Where mock data is used (filenames & functions)
- Where functionality is stubbed or incomplete (e.g., `TODO`, `FIXME`, placeholder handlers)
- Suggestions for wiring real data sources

---

## ✅ Immediate TODOs (for Cursor Actions)

Output a **list of one-line TODOs** that can be:
- Used for inline comments
- Converted into Cursor edit prompts
- Added to GitHub Issues (optional)

Each TODO should be:
- 🔹 Short & specific
- 💡 Actionable by a dev or AI
- 🧱 Linked to a real file or function

Example:
- `Refactor Form.tsx to extract error handling into separate hook`
- `Replace mockedProducts in ProductGrid.tsx with API integration layer`

---

## 💬 Final Notes

Keep the tone constructive and direct. Assume the developer will **use this output to drive immediate refactors inside Cursor**.

If you’re unsure about something (e.g., "should this be abstracted?"), call it out as a question.
