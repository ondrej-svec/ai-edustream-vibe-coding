# Task: Add Loading and Error UI States to Data-Driven Components

## What Needs to Be Done
Ensure all components that fetch or display data from an API show appropriate loading and error states.

## How to Do It
- Identify all components that fetch or depend on external data.
- Add state management for loading and error conditions.
- Display spinners, skeletons, or error messages as appropriate.
- Ensure the UI is accessible and user-friendly during these states.
- Add tests to verify correct behavior.

## Definition of Done
- All data-driven components show loading and error states.
- No component assumes data is always available.
- UI is accessible and provides clear feedback to users.
- Tests cover loading and error scenarios.
