# Task: Write Unit and Integration Tests for Key Components

## What Needs to Be Done
Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for `src/components/TasteQuiz.tsx`, `src/components/RecommendationsPanel.tsx`, and `src/pages/BeansList.tsx`.

## How to Do It
- Set up a testing framework (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library) if not already present.
- Write unit tests for all logic and UI branches in the components.
- Write integration tests for user flows (e.g., submitting the quiz, viewing recommendations).
- Cover edge cases and error conditions.
- Ensure tests are readable and maintainable.

## Definition of Done
- All major logic and UI flows are covered by tests.
- Edge cases and error conditions are tested.
- Tests are passing and provide confidence in component correctness.
