# Input Validation Gaps Inventory

This document lists all input validation and sanitization gaps found in the codebase.

---

## 1. src/components/TasteQuiz.tsx
- **Lines 84-99**: Only basic client-side validation (e.g., required fields) is present for the taste quiz form. No schema-based or type-safe validation is used.
  - **Risk:** Users could submit unexpected or malformed data, especially if bypassing the UI. No sanitization for string inputs.

## 2. src/pages/Index.tsx
- **Line 59**: TasteQuiz is used, but no additional validation or sanitization is performed before passing preferences to the next page.
  - **Risk:** Data passed between pages is not validated or sanitized.

## 3. src/components/ui/form.tsx
- **Throughout**: Form context and field management are present, but no explicit validation schemas or sanitization logic are enforced at the component level.
  - **Risk:** Potential for inconsistent validation across forms.

**Note:** No evidence of schema validation libraries (Yup, Zod, Joi) or input sanitization utilities in the codebase. Recommend implementing comprehensive validation and sanitization for all user input.
